Phase 1 — Object Storage Foundation

Files modified: object.c

object_write prepends a "<type> <size>\0" header to the data, hashes the
whole thing with SHA-256, skips writing if the object already exists
(deduplication), creates the shard directory, writes to a temp file, fsyncs,
and renames atomically. This guarantees the object store is never left with a
partial file even on a crash.

object_read reverifies the SHA-256 after reading (integrity check), parses
the type and declared size from the header, validates the declared size against
the actual byte count, then returns the data portion in a caller-owned buffer.
